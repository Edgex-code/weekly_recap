        "content": "U.S. equity markets fell sharply this week, with all major indexes declining as trade tensions, weak economic data, and mixed signals from the Fed weighed on sentiment. Markets were rattled after President Trump announced sweeping tariff increases, effective August 7, heightening uncertainty just days ahead of the deadline. Despite some new trade deals and extensions, tariff policy drove volatility. The Fed kept rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting. Markets grew more dovish after core PCE inflation rose 2.8% YoY in June and the July jobs report showed just 73,000 new jobs, far below expectations.

Inflation held firm at 2.0% headline and 2.3% core. Unemployment remained low at 6.2%, while economic sentiment improved, driven by better outlooks in industry, services, and retail. EU–U.S. trade deal fails to inspire confidence, the “framework” agreement keeps U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminium at 50%, with 15% tariffs on most other EU exports, down from earlier proposals but still restrictive.

Despite strong economic data, including a 1.7% rise in industrial production and 2.0% growth in retail sales for June, sentiment remained fragile. the Chinese equities declined as fresh U.S. tariff hikes dampened global growth sentiment and economic data pointed to a slowdown in China’s recovery. The latest S&P Global manufacturing PMI slid to 49.5 in July, below the expansion threshold and lower than June’s 50.4. Authorities cited weather disruptions, including heatwaves and flooding, as contributing factors to the slump in factory activity.

While this move hints at further upside potential, gains were capped after an NFP report. The greenback retreated sharply into August as markets reassessed expectations for economic strength and Fed policy direction. The yen depreciated past JPY 150 against the U.S. dollar—its weakest in four months—prompting warnings from Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato over speculative moves and FX volatility.

Although robust data supported the domestic outlook, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond eased to 1.55%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment and ongoing uncertainty around global trade policy and monetary tightening trajectories.
